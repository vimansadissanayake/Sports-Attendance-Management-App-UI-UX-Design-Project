🏟️ Sports Attendance Management App (UI/UX Design)

The Sports Attendance Management App is a modern UI/UX design concept created to improve the way university sports attendance is recorded and managed. Traditional manual attendance methods are time-consuming and error-prone; this project proposes a clean, digital solution designed using Figma.

The app enables real-time attendance tracking for sports practices and gym sessions, making it easier for students to stay accountable, for coaches to monitor participation, and for administrators to manage sports programs efficiently. The interface is designed with a strong focus on usability, clarity, and accessibility, ensuring a smooth user experience across all user roles.

This project highlights my interest in UI/UX design, user-centered thinking, and solving real-world problems through intuitive digital interfaces.
